          <h2>FOUNDING KONG LAND</h2>
          <p>
            Human coordination is increasingly taking place not in physical
            locations, but rather digital forums. For the past decade these
            forums have been hosted, moderated and controlled by interests that
            are prone to arbitrary censorship and whose existence is in
            diametric opposition to the privacy of their users. Cryptographic
            tools like public key cryptography coupled with distributed networks
            now allow for direct human coordination, free from moderation by
            centralized institutions. Many thinkers have proposed [May, Szabo]
            that crypto-organization would be possible at scale given these
            tools, but only now have we started to collectively realize DAOs as
            functional governing bodies which collectively hold over $1 billion
            USD in assets under their control across 65,000 members.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're now at a tipping point where DAOs are inevitable as the
            fastest growing means of human coordination in juxtaposition to
            traditional corporate and state structures, however, they are
            largely unable to cross the digital to physical barrier. KONG Land
            is founded on the principle that DAOs can only cross into the
            physical realm entirely when they are given strong cryptographic
            guarantees about people, objects and spaces. Our belief is that
            physical crypto assets enable everyone to participate in these new
            forms of organization without perfect technical sophistication. KONG
            Land is intended not just to be a DAO itself, but rather a DAO of
            DAOs, or digital nation of them, wherein the primary export are
            physical crypto tools and products and services built upon them.
          </p>

          <p>
            KONG Cash is the first example of a physical crypto asset that is
            designed to allow anyone to intuitively earn, spend and save
            cryptocurrency. It provides a blueprint for a Kong Land DAO focused
            on stablecoin crypto cash notes in places where inflation in local
            currencies is high and many people still use cash. KONG Land
            passports are the first instance of a physical burner
            cryptoidentity; they can be used not only in cyberspace for on-chain
            transactions, but also in the real world to gain entry to spaces.
            SiLo's, a superset of KONG technology are being integrated into
            merchandise and collectables that have been created and
            authenticated by projects like MetaFactory and Mattereum. The
            potential for physical crypto assets is far beyond the scope of what
            a single DAO could envision, and so KONG is open today to broad
            coordination.
          </p>

          <p>
            At inception, KONG Land will export cryptoassets for projects like
            stablecoins, identities, goods and more. It will provide KONG
            technology at cost and free from duties to projects that supply a
            portion of their governance token to the KONG treasury. Given
            sufficient funds, it will ultimately seek to continue research
            around more secure forms of physical crypto assets. In some cases
            the KONG Land will have to interact with tradcorps in order to
            source and produce materiel, and it will effect entites to achieve
            those end. Importantly the KONG Land will consider and evaluate key
            storage devices by their origin and manufacture in order to create
            an indepedent registry of roots of trust.
